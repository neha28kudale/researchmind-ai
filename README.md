# 🧠 ResearchMind AI

ResearchMind AI is an **autonomous research assistant** that helps users explore academic papers, identify contradictions, highlight gaps, and generate confidence-scored reports.  
Simply enter a research topic, and the system autonomously searches, ranks, analyzes, and synthesizes findings into a structured research report.
